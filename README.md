This game displays a set of colors by a computer and the players objective is to mimic and select the same colors the computer does. If the player does not select the correct sequence the computer made then the player fails.

 Push the 'start' button to begin the game. Once the game is started the computer will begin its first sequence, which starts with one color. Each turn of the computer will add one more move to its sequence. Select the same color as the computer did and make the same sequence as the computers. If you don't make the same sequence you loose.

## Next Steps 

 Further improvements I would like to add to this game
 adding multiple levels, which inlcudes more colors to remember,
 different stages that change according to the new level.
 New stages will have there own theme, background and soundtrack will change.
 Add a winner condition, where theres a goal for the player to reach.
